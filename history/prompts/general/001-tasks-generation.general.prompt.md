## Prompt

is in progress

## Response

Generated comprehensive tasks.md file for the educational book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. The tasks are organized by user stories with clear dependencies and implementation phases:

- **Phase 1**: Setup (project initialization)
- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites)
- **Phase 3**: User Story 1 - Learning Core Concepts (P1)
- **Phase 4**: User Story 2 - Simulating Humanoid Robotics (P1)
- **Phase 5**: User Story 3 - VLA Integration (P2)
- **Phase 6**: User Story 4 - Deployment (P2)
- **Phase 7**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

Each task follows the required format with IDs, parallel markers [P], story labels [US1-US4], and specific file paths. The implementation strategy includes MVP-first approach, incremental delivery, and parallel team execution options.

## Outcome

Successfully created a comprehensive task list with 48 specific tasks across 7 phases, each with clear file paths and dependencies. The tasks are organized to enable independent implementation and testing of each user story as required by the specification.

## Evaluation

The generated tasks.md file meets all requirements:
- Follows the checklist format with proper task IDs
- Includes parallel markers [P] where appropriate
- Contains story labels [US1-US4] for user story organization
- Specifies exact file paths for each task
- Maintains proper dependencies between phases
- Enables independent testing of each user story
