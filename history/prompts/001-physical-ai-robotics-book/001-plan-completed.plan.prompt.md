  Completed the plan for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book, including technical context, constitution check, research, data model, contracts, and quickstart. Suggested ADR for technical stack and conceptual data model.
outcome: "Plan generated and artifacts created. ADR suggestion provided."
evaluation: "The /sp.plan command executed successfully. All required artifacts were generated, and a relevant ADR suggestion was made based on the architectural decisions in the plan. The todo list was managed correctly throughout the process."
