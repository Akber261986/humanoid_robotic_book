# create-implementation-tasks

## Intent


## Response
Generated comprehensive tasks for the RAG-enabled Gemini Chatbot implementation. The tasks.md file includes 46 tasks organized across 6 phases: Setup, Foundational, User Story 1 (Query Humanoid Robotics Knowledge), User Story 2 (View Source Citations), User Story 3 (Persistent Chat Session), and Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns. Tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths. The implementation strategy prioritizes User Story 1 as an MVP with clear dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified.

## Outcome
Created comprehensive task list with 46 tasks organized by user story priority

## Evaluation
Success
