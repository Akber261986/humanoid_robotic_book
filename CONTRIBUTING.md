- Include comments to explain complex or non-obvious code sections
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code
- Use meaningful variable names that reflect the context

- Ensure all examples are tested and reproducible

## Markdown Formatting

- Use proper heading hierarchy (H1 for main sections, H2 for subsections, etc.)

- Use bold for emphasis and important terms
- Use code blocks for file paths, commands, and technical terms
- Use blockquotes for important notes or warnings
